"""Scripted expert for the quarter fold: one FoldExpert per (stage, arm) move,
staged. Both stages run the same synchronized-pair pattern: two FoldExperts
act every step, both hold their placed corners until the other has placed too,
then both release and retreat together.

A released corner springs back: the fold's bend pulls it a few centimetres
toward the fold line and the flap narrows across it. Placed exactly on the
goal, corners settle away from it and the fold fails, so each move places past
its goal by an OVERSHOOT (the mean spring-back measured on the stock cloth).
Stage 1 carries both west-edge points east onto the east edge (right arm: the
two-layer south stack -> cloth_110; left arm: the crease-end vertex ->
cloth_115), so both overshoot a little further east (+x) than their goal.
Feasibility check:

    python -m cloth_fold_rl.quarter_fold_expert --episodes 5
