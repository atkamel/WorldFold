# Status

**Updated:** 2026-09-23 · **Branch:** `feature/imitation` · **Phase:** 4-5 (sensor-only student, offline RL)

One-screen answer to "where are we". Update at the end of **every work pass** (see
`CLAUDE.md`), and add a line to the pass log at the bottom. Full plan in
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md); spec in [imitation.md](imitation.md); numbers in
[results.md](results.md).

## Where we are

Phases 1-3 are done. **DAgger (M3.2) met its exit:** `dagger_v2/round_3` scores
97.0 / 64.5 / 65.0% (id_easy / id_hard / recovery, n=200), up from BC's 98.0 / 69.5 /
38.5%. That came after fixing the teacher-label bug that sank dagger_v1. id_hard didn't
improve, because DAgger rollouts never visit shifted poses. The Phase 4-5 queue
(`outputs/imitation/runs/phase3to5.sh`) is running: diffusion eval (M2.4), harvest
(M5.1), IQL + eval (M5.3), vision BC eval, distillation (M4.2), detector agreement (M4.3).

## Next action

Let `phase3to5.sh` finish (`outputs/imitation/runs/phase3to5.out`), record each result,
then render the half-fold demo from the best checkpoint.

## Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| pins | `imitation/requirements.txt` — mujoco **3.10.0**, so101-nexus **0.4.8**, numpy 2.5.1, gymnasium 1.3.0 |
| torch | 2.13.0+cu130, **CUDA available** |
| tests | 79 fast + 9 slow, all passing (`pytest -m "not slow"` / `-m slow`) |

⚠️ `cloth_fold_rl/requirements.txt` pins mujoco 3.11.0 / so101-nexus 0.5.1 for its own
committed checkpoint. Do not "unify" these without re-running the expert benchmark — cloth
grasping is contact-dominated and MuJoCo minors change results.

## Frozen datasets

| version | episodes | source | hash | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | 384 (+16 in `v1_failures`) | expert, seeds 0-399, 30% perturbed | `769dd372719c` | successes only; 38,136 steps; failures hash `699a1dc71c71` |

Collection log: `outputs/imitation/collect_v1_m1_8.log`. The earlier failed attempt is
kept as `outputs/imitation/collect_v1.log`.

## Best checkpoint

`outputs/imitation/runs/dagger_v2/round_3/final.pt`: DAgger (shadowing teacher) on
`v1_dagger_v2_r3`, 97.0 / 64.5 / 65.0% (n=200, deterministic eval). `run.json` +
`history.json` are the record.

## Open blockers and known defects

Ordered by what they block. Each is a roadmap milestone.

| # | defect | blocks | milestone |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | `v1_dagger_v1_r1`/`_r2` frozen with bad teacher labels — never train on them | DAgger | — |
| 10 | `cloth_angles/tasks.py::QUARTER` diverged from `quarter_fold_env.STAGES` (3 ways) | world-model work only (parked) | M7.3 |

## Parked

- **World model** (`cloth_angles/`) — off the critical path by decision. Its task
  definition has diverged and must be reconciled or deleted before any result from it
  counts.
- **VLA** — enters at Phase 6 as a subgoal proposer, not an action labeler. MolmoAct emits
  8×6 absolute joint degrees, single arm; the env takes 12-D normalized dual-arm deltas.
- **PPO** — `cloth_fold_rl/train.py` and `bc.py` are superseded and deleted in M7.2. The
  unrelated `MuJoCoTouch-v1` PPO baseline stays.
